    "In this game, you are a \"princess\" and the goal is to rescue \"price\". But be careful, there is a snake monster that could hit you!\n",

    "## I used pygame.\n",
    "This pygame library is really REALLY amazing for creating a game. \n",
    "I originally thought that creating game needs a \"serious\" computer science degree, and it is out of my reach. Creating graphical user interface seemed very complicated! How can my script accepts keyboard input, do calculation and then update the game screen accodingly? No worry, pygame will take care of such things, so you can focus on creating game logics (e.g., how to score points, what decides \"game over\"). [In fact the game above requires only about 400 lines.](https://github.com/FairyOnIce/SavePrinceGame/blob/master/SavePrince.py)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Where did I start?\n",
    "Did I take any online courses? Well, yes and no. All I did was follow [this great youtube series from thenewboston](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5F-aGDIYaM). This series has many tutorial videos. I watched the first 40 (40!). Each tutorial is nicely modularized and takes only about 5 - 10 minutes. I would love to watch the rest later in my life! \n",
